# STACKER GAME 

Based on the old arcade game "stacker".
You are given a grid and for each row from the bottom, you are given a platform of blocks.
Your goal is to stack as many platforms on top of each other.
If you make it to the top, you win. 
If you get a perfect score of 180, there's a _*special easter egg*_.
